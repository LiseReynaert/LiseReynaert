### Hi there, I'm Lise ðŸ˜„

I am a statistician, and I strive to transform data into understanding by combining fundamental concepts, technical skills, domain expertise and storytelling. 

âš¡ I am currently interested in machine learning and NLP, and I enjoy creating funny little project to put what I learn into practice!

Welcome to my github page !
